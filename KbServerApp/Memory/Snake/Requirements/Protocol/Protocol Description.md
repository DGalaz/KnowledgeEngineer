# System Analysis

The system is a multiplayer game with a server-client architecture. The server manages the game state, calculates game steps, and communicates with the clients. The clients interact with the users and send user inputs to the server. The server and clients communicate using a protocol that needs to be defined.

# Network Protocol Design

The network protocol will be based on JSON messages. Each message will have a type and a payload. The type will indicate the purpose of the message, and the payload will contain the data associated with that message.

## Message Types

1. **AssignColor**: This message is sent from the server to the client when a client joins the game. The payload will contain the color assigned to the client's snake.

2. **UpdateBoard**: This message is sent from the server to the client to update the game board. The payload will contain a list of squares that changed and their new color.

3. **DeathNotification**: This message is sent from the server to the client to notify the client if its snake has died.

4. **WinnerAnnouncement**: This message is sent from the server to the client to announce the winner of the game. The payload will contain the color of the last surviving snake.

5. **GameStartCountdown**: This message is sent from the server to the client to initiate a countdown to the start of the game.

6. **JoinGame**: This message is sent from the client to the server when the user decides to join the game.

7. **ArrowKeyEvent**: This message is sent from the client to the server when there is a change in the state of the arrow keys.
