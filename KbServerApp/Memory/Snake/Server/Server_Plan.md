# Plan to Implement SnakeServer.py

1. **Setup the Server**
    - Import necessary libraries (http.server, websockets, asyncio, json).
    - Define the server class with necessary attributes (game board, game state, list of clients, etc.).

2. **Initialize the Game**
    - Define a method to initialize the game state (game board, snake positions, etc.).
    - This method should be called when the server starts and after each game ends.

3. **Manage Client Connections**
    - Define a method to handle new client connections.
    - Assign a color to each new client and send an AssignColor message.
    - Add the client to the list of clients.

4. **Handle Client Messages**
    - Define a method to handle incoming messages from clients.
    - Parse the JSON message and perform the appropriate action based on the message type.
    - For JoinGame messages, add the client's snake to the game board.
    - For ArrowKeyEvent messages, update the direction of the client's snake.

5. **Game Loop**
    - Define a method for the game loop that runs at a rate of 15 steps per second.
    - Each step, calculate the movement of each snake, determine if any snakes die, and determine what squares need color changes.
    - After each step, send an UpdateBoard message to each client with the changes.

6. **Death and Winning**
    - If a snake dies, send a DeathNotification message to the corresponding client.
    - If there is only one snake left, send a WinnerAnnouncement message to all clients with the color of the winning snake.

7. **Start Countdown**
    - When the first client joins after the end of a game, start a 30-second countdown.
    - Send a GameStartCountdown message to all clients with the remaining time.
    - When the countdown ends, start the game.

8. **Run the Server**
    - Define the main function to run the server.
    - Initialize the server and start listening for client connections.
    - Start the game loop.
