```md
# Step 1: Import the necessary modules

- `asyncio` for asynchronous programming.
- `websockets` for WebSocket communication.
- `http.server` for serving the HTML and JavaScript files to the clients.
```

Step_2.md
```md
# Step 2: Define the WebSocket server class

- Create a class called `SnakeServer` that inherits from `websockets.WebSocketServerProtocol`.
- Implement the `__init__` method to initialize the server.
- Implement the `connection_made` method to handle new client connections.
- Implement the `connection_lost` method to handle client disconnections.
- Implement the `receive_message` method to handle incoming messages from clients.
```

Step_3.md
```md
# Step 3: Implement the game logic

- Create a class called `Game` to manage the game state and logic.
- Implement the necessary methods to handle game initialization, updating the game state, detecting snake deaths, and announcing the winner.
- Use a data structure to represent the game board and track the state of each square.
- Calculate the movement of each snake on each step of the game.
- Implement a mechanism to handle client input and update the game state accordingly.
```

Step_4.md
```md
# Step 4: Define the message types and their handling

- Define the message types mentioned earlier: `JoinGame`, `StartGame`, `UpdateGameState`, `PlayerDeath`, `Winner`, and `RestartGame`.
- Implement methods in the `SnakeServer` class to handle each message type.
- Parse the incoming JSON messages and perform the necessary actions based on the message type.
- Send the appropriate response messages to the clients.
```

Step_5.md
```md
# Step 5: Implement the HTTP server

- Create a class called `SnakeHTTPServer` that inherits from `http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`.
- Implement the necessary methods to serve the HTML and JavaScript files to the clients.
- Set up the HTTP server to listen on port 8090 and handle requests.
```

Step_6.md
```md
# Step 6: Start the server

- Create an instance of the `SnakeHTTPServer` class and start the HTTP server.
- Create an instance of the `SnakeServer` class and start the WebSocket server.
- Run the event loop to handle incoming WebSocket connections and messages.
```

Step_7.md
```md
# Step 7: Test the server

- Open a web browser and navigate to `localhost:8090` to test the client-side functionality.
- Verify that multiple clients can join and play the game simultaneously.
- Test the game logic, including snake movement, collision detection, and winner announcement.
