# Plan to Implement SnakeServer.py

1. Import necessary libraries:
    - asyncio for asynchronous I/O, networking, and concurrency.
    - websockets for WebSocket protocol handling.
    - json for JSON serialization and deserialization.

2. Define the SnakeServer class:
    - Initialize the class with the following attributes:
        - A list of clients.
        - A dictionary to store the game state.
        - A dictionary to store the arrow key states of each client.
        - A dictionary to store the colors assigned to each client.
        - A variable to store the game start countdown.
        - A variable to store the current game state.

3. Define the following methods in the SnakeServer class:
    - `register_client`: Add a new client to the list of clients and assign a color to it.
    - `unregister_client`: Remove a client from the list of clients.
    - `update_arrow_key_state`: Update the arrow key state of a client.
    - `calculate_game_state`: Calculate the game state 15 times per second. This includes the movement of each snake, determining if any snakes die, and determining what squares need color changes.
    - `send_game_state`: Send the game state to each client.
    - `announce_death`: Announce to a client if it has died.
    - `announce_winner`: Announce the color of the last surviving snake at the end of the game.
    - `manage_game_state_transition`: Manage the game start countdown and the transition between game states.

4. Define the `start_server` function:
    - Initialize a new instance of the SnakeServer class.
    - Start the WebSocket server and register the necessary event handlers.

5. In the `main` function:
    - Call the `start_server` function.
    - Start the asyncio event loop.

6. If the script is run directly (not imported as a module), call the `main` function.
