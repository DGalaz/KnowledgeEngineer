# Step 3: Implement the game logic

- Create a class called `Game` to manage the game state and logic.
- Implement the necessary methods to handle game initialization, updating the game state, detecting snake deaths, and announcing the winner.
- Use a data structure to represent the game board and track the state of each square.
- Calculate the movement of each snake on each step of the game.
- Implement a mechanism to handle client input and update the game state accordingly.
