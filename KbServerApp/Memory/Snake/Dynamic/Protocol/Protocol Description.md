# System Analysis

The system is a multiplayer game with a server-client architecture. The server manages the game state and communicates with multiple clients. The clients interact with the users and communicate with the server. The communication between the server and the clients is defined by a protocol.

# Network Protocol Design

The network protocol will be based on JSON messages. The following message types will be used:

1. GameState: This message type is used by the server to send game state updates to the clients. It includes information about the movement of each snake, the squares that need color changes, and the status of each client (alive or dead).

2. ArrowKeyState: This message type is used by the clients to send arrow key state changes to the server. It includes information about the state of the arrow keys for each client.

3. DeathAnnouncement: This message type is used by the server to announce to the clients if they have died. It includes information about the client that has died.

4. WinnerAnnouncement: This message type is used by the server to announce the color of the last surviving snake at the end of the game. It includes information about the color of the winning snake.

5. GameStateTransition: This message type is used by the server to manage the game start countdown and the transition between game states. It includes information about the current game state and the countdown to the next game state.
