The system described is a multiplayer snake game where the server manages the game state and communicates with the clients. The clients interact with the user and communicate with the server. The protocol defines the communication between the server and the clients.

The network protocol designed for this application will be based on JSON messages. The messages will be of different types, each serving a specific purpose in the application. 

The first message type is `GameUpdate`. This message is sent by the server to the clients at each step of the game. It contains a list of squares that have changed and their new color. This allows the clients to update their view of the game board.

GameUpdate.json
```json
{
    "type": "GameUpdate",
    "payload": {
        "changedSquares": [
            {
                "x": 0,
                "y": 0,
                "color": "#FF0000"
            },
            {
                "x": 1,
                "y": 1,
                "color": "#00FF00"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The second message type is `KeyEvent`. This message is sent by the clients to the server whenever there is a change in the state of the arrow keys. This allows the server to update the game state based on the user's input.

KeyEvent.json
```json
{
    "type": "KeyEvent",
    "payload": {
        "key": "ArrowUp"
    }
}
```

The third message type is `DeathNotification`. This message is sent by the server to a client when the client's snake dies. This allows the client to display a death message to the user.

DeathNotification.json
```json
{
    "type": "DeathNotification",
    "payload": {}
}
```

The fourth message type is `WinnerAnnouncement`. This message is sent by the server to the clients when the game ends. It contains the color of the last surviving snake. This allows the clients to display a winner message to the user.

WinnerAnnouncement.json
```json
{
    "type": "WinnerAnnouncement",
    "payload": {
        "color": "#FF0000"
    }
}
```

The fifth message type is `GameReset`. This message is sent by the server to the clients after the game ends. This allows the clients to reset their state and prepare for a new game.

GameReset.json
```json
{
    "type": "GameReset",
    "payload": {}
}
```
