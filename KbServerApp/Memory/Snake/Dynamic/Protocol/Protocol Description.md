The system described is a multiplayer game where each player controls a snake. The game board is managed by a server, which calculates the game state and communicates with the clients. The clients are responsible for displaying the game to the user and sending user input to the server. The server and clients communicate using a protocol that includes sending game updates, user input, and game status messages.

Based on this system, we can design a network protocol using JSON messages. The protocol will include the following message types:

1. GameUpdate: This message is sent by the server to the clients to update the game state. It includes a list of squares that have changed and their new colors.

2. UserInput: This message is sent by the client to the server to communicate changes in the state of the arrow keys.

3. GameStatus: This message is sent by the server to the clients to communicate the status of the game, such as whether a client's snake has died or the color of the last surviving snake.

4. Countdown: This message is sent by the server to the clients to initiate a 30-second countdown to the start of the game when the first client joins after the end of a game.
