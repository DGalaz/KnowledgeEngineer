# Server

The server is responsible for managing the game logic and facilitating communication between the clients. It performs the following tasks:

- Manages the game board, which is a 100 x 100 grid of squares.
- Calculates the movement of each snake on each step of the game.
- Determines if any snakes have died.
- Tracks the squares that need color changes.
- Sends the updated game state to each client.

## Requirements

To implement the server, the following requirements should be considered:

- The server should be able to handle multiple concurrent connections from clients.
- It should have a high-performance network stack to handle the real-time nature of the game.
- The server should be able to process game logic and update the game state at a rate of 15 steps per second.
- It should have a data structure to represent the game board and track the state of each square.
- The server should be able to handle client input and update the game state accordingly.
- It should have a mechanism to detect when a snake dies and remove it from the game.
- The server should be able to send the updated game state to each client efficiently.
- It should handle the start and end of the game, including managing the countdown and announcing the winner.

Client.md

# Client

The client is responsible for rendering the game board and handling user input. It performs the following tasks:

- Connects to the server and joins the game.
- Displays the game board and the player's snake.
- Shows a countdown to the start of the game.
- Updates the server with any change events to the state of the arrow keys.
- Receives updates from the server and updates the game board accordingly.
- Displays a message if the player's snake dies.
- Shows the winner message at the end of the game.

## Requirements

To implement the client, the following requirements should be considered:

- The client should have a graphical user interface to display the game board and messages.
- It should be able to connect to the server and establish a network connection.
- The client should be able to send user input to the server, indicating changes to the state of the arrow keys.
- It should receive updates from the server and update the game board accordingly.
- The client should be able to render the game board and the player's snake in real-time.
- It should display a countdown to the start of the game and update it as necessary.
- The client should handle messages from the server, such as notifications of snake death and the winner message at the end of the game.

```

Protocol.md
```markdown
# Protocol

The protocol defines the communication between the server and the clients. It includes the following messages:

- JoinGame: Sent by the client to join the game.
- StartGame: Sent by the server to indicate the start of the game.
- UpdateGameState: Sent by the server to update the game state.
- PlayerDeath: Sent by the server to notify the client of the player's snake death.
- Winner: Sent by the server to announce the winner of the game.
- RestartGame: Sent by the server to indicate the start of a new game.

The protocol should be designed to be efficient and minimize network traffic. It should also handle any potential errors or disconnections gracefully.
