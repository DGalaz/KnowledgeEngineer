# Server Implementation Plan for Snake Online Game

This document outlines the implementation plan for the server-side of the Snake Online Game, mapping each requirement to specific functions with their interfaces and logic.

## 1. Python 3 and Async IO

### Function: `start_server`
- **Interface**: `async def start_server(host: str, port: int) -> None`
- **Logic**:
  - Initialize the main server coroutine.
  - Set up the event loop for asynchronous operations.
  - Call `run_server` to start the server.

## 2. aiohttp Web Server

### Function: `run_server`
- **Interface**: `async def run_server(app: aiohttp.web.Application) -> None`
- **Logic**:
  - Configure the aiohttp web server to serve `SnakeClient.html`.
  - Start the web server on the specified host and port.
  - Register routes for static files.

## 3. WebSockets Support

### Function: `websocket_handler`
- **Interface**: `async def websocket_handler(request: aiohttp.web.Request) -> None`
- **Logic**:
  - Establish a WebSocket connection with the client.
  - Add the WebSocket to the list of connected clients.
  - Listen for incoming messages and handle them accordingly.
  - Handle disconnections and clean up resources.

## 4. Game Board Management

### Function: `initialize_game_board`
- **Interface**: `def initialize_game_board() -> str`
- **Logic**:
  - Create a 100x100 2D character array filled with spaces.
  - Return the initialized game board as a string.

## 5. Game Tick Logic

### Function: `game_tick`
- **Interface**: `async def game_tick() -> None`
- **Logic**:
  - Schedule ticks to occur 5 times per second.
  - For each tick, move snakes, check for collisions, and update the game state.
  - Broadcast the updated game status to all clients.

## 6. Snake Movement and Collision Detection

### Function: `move_snake`
- **Interface**: `def move_snake(snake: list, direction: tuple) -> list`
- **Logic**:
  - Calculate the new head position based on the current direction.
  - Check for collisions with boundaries or other snakes.
  - Return the updated snake positions or handle death if a collision occurs.

## 7. Score and Food Management

### Function: `update_score_and_food`
- **Interface**: `def update_score_and_food(snake: list, game_board: str) -> (int, list)`
- **Logic**:
  - Check if the snake has eaten food.
  - Update the score and regenerate food at a random empty space.
  - Return the updated score and food positions.

## 8. Client Management

### Function: `manage_client`
- **Interface**: `def manage_client(client: dict, action: str) -> None`
- **Logic**:
  - Handle client join requests and assign characters.
  - Update client direction based on received messages.
  - Remove clients on disconnection and return characters to the pool.

## 9. Client Character Assignment

### Function: `assign_client_character`
- **Interface**: `def assign_client_character(client: dict) -> str`
- **Logic**:
  - Assign a unique character to a new client from the available pool.
  - Return the assigned character.

## 10. Client Reset and Snake Respawn

### Function: `reset_client`
- **Interface**: `def reset_client(client: dict, game_board: str) -> None`
- **Logic**:
  - Reset the client's snake and score when the snake dies.
  - Respawn the snake at a random position with enough space.

## 11. Message Broadcasting

### Function: `broadcast_game_status`
- **Interface**: `async def broadcast_game_status(clients: dict, game_status: dict) -> None`
- **Logic**:
  - Serialize the current game status into a JSON string.
  - Send the game status to all connected WebSocket clients.

## 12. Handling Client Messages

### Function: `handle_client_message`
- **Interface**: `async def handle_client_message(message: dict, client: dict) -> None`
- **Logic**:
  - Parse the received message and determine its type.
  - Call the appropriate function to handle "Joining", "DirectionChange", etc.

## 13. HTTP Server Startup

### Function: `serve_client_html`
- **Interface**: `async def serve_client_html() -> None`
- **Logic**:
  - Start the HTTP server to serve the `SnakeClient.html` file to clients.

## 14. Resource Cleanup

### Function: `cleanup_resources`
- **Interface**: `def cleanup_resources(client: dict) -> None`
- **Logic**:
  - Perform necessary cleanup when a client disconnects.
  - Remove the client from the game state and free up resources.

## 15. Error Handling

### Function: `handle_error`
- **Interface**: `def handle_error(error: Exception) -> None`
- **Logic**:
  - Log the error.
  - Ensure the server continues to operate and does not crash.
  - Handle specific exceptions gracefully.

Each function will be thoroughly documented with docstrings, including parameters, return values, and any exceptions that may be raised. The server will be structured to ensure efficient and scalable handling of multiple clients in the asynchronous environment provided by Python 3 and the aiohttp library.
