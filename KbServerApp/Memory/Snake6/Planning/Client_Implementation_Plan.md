# Client Implementation Plan for Snake Online Game

This document outlines the implementation plan for the client-side of the Snake Online Game, mapping each requirement to specific functions and detailing the interface and logic of each function.

## 1. Single HTML File (`SnakeClient.html`)

### Function: `initializeClient()`
- **Interface**: This function will be called when the HTML document is loaded.
- **Logic**: It will set up the initial state of the client, including loading the CSS and JavaScript within the single HTML file.

## 2. WebSockets Communication

### Function: `connectWebSocket()`
- **Interface**: This function will establish a WebSocket connection to the server.
- **Logic**: It will handle the WebSocket events such as onopen, onmessage, onerror, and onclose.

### Function: `sendMessage(messageType, data)`
- **Interface**: This function will send messages to the server with the specified type and data.
- **Logic**: It will serialize the data into a JSON string and send it through the WebSocket connection.

## 3. User Interface

### Function: `promptUsername()`
- **Interface**: This function will prompt the user for a username.
- **Logic**: It will display a prompt dialog and return the entered username.

### Function: `updateGameBoard(gameBoard)`
- **Interface**: This function will update the game board display.
- **Logic**: It will iterate over the game board array and update the HTML elements accordingly.

### Function: `updateStatusBar(clients)`
- **Interface**: This function will update the status bar with the client list.
- **Logic**: It will create a string representation of the client list and update the status bar element.

## 4. Game Board Display

### Function: `drawGameBoard()`
- **Interface**: This function will draw the game board on the screen.
- **Logic**: It will create a 100x100 grid of HTML elements and apply the necessary styles.

## 5. Client List in Status Bar

### Function: `drawStatusBar()`
- **Interface**: This function will draw the status bar on the screen.
- **Logic**: It will create an HTML element for the status bar and set its initial content.

## 6. Handling User Input

### Function: `handleArrowKeyPress(event)`
- **Interface**: This function will be an event handler for arrow key presses.
- **Logic**: It will detect the arrow key pressed and send a "DirectionChange" message to the server.

## 7. Displaying Game Updates

### Function: `processGameStatus(gameStatus)`
- **Interface**: This function will process the "GameStatus" message from the server.
- **Logic**: It will update the game board and client list based on the received game status.

## 8. Handling Game Events

### Function: `showSnakeDiedDialog()`
- **Interface**: This function will show a pop-up dialog when the snake dies.
- **Logic**: It will display a dialog with a message indicating that the snake has died.

## 9. Error Handling and Reconnection

### Function: `handleWebSocketError(event)`
- **Interface**: This function will handle WebSocket errors.
- **Logic**: It will attempt to reconnect and inform the user of the error.

## 10. Visual and Aesthetic Design

### Function: `applyStyles()`
- **Interface**: This function will apply visual styles to the client interface.
- **Logic**: It will use CSS to style the HTML elements for a visually appealing design.

## 11. Cross-Browser Compatibility

### Function: `checkBrowserCompatibility()`
- **Interface**: This function will check for browser compatibility.
- **Logic**: It will test for features required by the client and alert the user if their browser is not supported.

## 12. Responsive Design

### Function: `adjustLayoutForScreenSize()`
- **Interface**: This function will adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
- **Logic**: It will use media queries and responsive design techniques to ensure the client looks good on all devices.

## 13. Security Considerations

### Function: `sanitizeInput(input)`
- **Interface**: This function will sanitize user input.
- **Logic**: It will remove any potentially dangerous characters or strings from the input to prevent XSS attacks.

## 14. Performance Optimization

### Function: `optimizePerformance()`
- **Interface**: This function will implement performance optimizations.
- **Logic**: It will use techniques such as requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering and minimize DOM updates.

## 15. Accessibility

### Function: `ensureAccessibility()`
- **Interface**: This function will ensure the client is accessible.
- **Logic**: It will follow accessibility standards, such as providing alt text for images and ensuring keyboard navigability.

Each function will be extensively documented within the codebase to ensure clarity and maintainability. The implementation will follow best practices for web development, including separation of concerns, modular design, and adherence to web standards.
