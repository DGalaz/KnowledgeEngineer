Log of Step: VerifyConfiguration : Asterisk/Prompts/VerifyConfiguration.pe


 - The configuration files for realtime ODBC/PostgreSQL are as follows:

1. `res_odbc.conf`:
```
[asterisk-connector]
enabled => yes
dsn => asterisk-connector
username => asterisk
password => your_password
pooling => no
limit => 1
pre-connect => yes
```

2. `extconfig.conf`:
```
[settings]
sippeers => odbc,asterisk-connector,sippeers
extensions => odbc,asterisk-connector,extensions
```

3. `res_config_odbc.conf`:
```
; Reset to minimal/empty configuration
```

4. `odbc.ini`:
```
[UbuntuTest]
Description = Ubuntu PostgreSQL database
Driver = PostgreSQL Unicode
Servername = localhost
Database = ubuntu
UserName = ubuntu
Password = Zacapa@100
Port = 5432

[asterisk-connector]
Description = PostgreSQL connector for Asterisk
Driver = PostgreSQL Unicode
Database = asterisk
Servername = localhost
UserName = asterisk
Password = Zacapa@100
Port = 5432
```

Please note that the `res_pgsql.conf` file was not found in the specified directory.

To verify if the configuration files are complete and consistent, we need to check the following:

1. Make sure the ODBC driver and PostgreSQL server are installed and configured correctly on the server.
2. Verify that the DSN (`asterisk-connector`) in `res_odbc.conf` matches the DSN in `odbc.ini`.
3. Check if the username and password in `res_odbc.conf` and `odbc.ini` are correct and have the necessary privileges to access the Asterisk and Ubuntu databases.
4. Ensure that the database names (`asterisk` and `ubuntu`) in `odbc.ini` match the actual database names in PostgreSQL.
5. Confirm that the servername and port in `odbc.ini` are correct and point to the PostgreSQL server.
6. Verify that the `sippeers` and `extensions` tables exist in the Asterisk database and have the necessary columns for realtime configuration.

To test if realtime is set up correctly and working, you can try adding or modifying entries in the `sippeers` or `extensions` tables in the PostgreSQL database and check if the changes are reflected in Asterisk without the need to reload or restart the server.
