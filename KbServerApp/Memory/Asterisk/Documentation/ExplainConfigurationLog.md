Log of Step: ExplainConfiguration : Asterisk/Prompts/ExplainConfiguration.pe


 - The configuration files have been modified to use AIX instead of pjsip. The `pjsip.conf` file has been updated to `sip.conf`, and the configuration syntax has been adjusted accordingly. The `extensions.conf` file remains the same. You can now use the AIX configuration for your Asterisk setup.
