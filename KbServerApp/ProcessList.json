The clients interact with the user and communicate with the server. The protocol defines the communication between the server and the clients.\n\nThe network protocol designed for this application will be based on JSON messages. The messages will be of different types, each serving a specific purpose in the application. \n\nThe first message type is `GameUpdate`.

Import necessary libraries:\n    - asyncio for asynchronous I/O, networking, and concurrency.\n    - websockets for WebSocket protocol handling.\n    - json for JSON message encoding and decoding.\n\n2. Define the game state:\n    - A 100x100 grid to represent the game board.\n    - A list of snakes, each represented by a list of squares and a color.\n    - A list of squares that have changed since the last step.\n\n3. Define the WebSocket server:\n    - The server listens on localhost:8090.\n    - When a client connects, assign them a color and add a snake to the game state.\n    - When a client disconnects, remove their snake from the game state.\n\n4. Define the game loop:\n    - The loop runs at a rate of 15 steps per second.\n    - Each step, calculate the movement of each snake based on the last KeyEvent received from its client.\n    - If a snake moves into a wall or another snake, remove it from the game state and send a DeathNotification to its client.\n    - If a snake moves into a free square, add the square to the snake and to the list of changed squares.\n    - If only one snake remains, send a WinnerAnnouncement to all clients and reset the game state.\n\n5. Define the message handling:\n    - When a GameUpdate message is received, update the list of changed squares and their colors in the game state.\n    - When a KeyEvent message is received, update the direction of the corresponding snake.\n    - When a DeathNotification message is received, remove the corresponding snake from the game state.\n    - When a WinnerAnnouncement message is received, reset the game state.\n    - When a GameReset message is received, reset the game state.\n\n6. Define the message sending:\n    - At each step, send a GameUpdate message to all clients with the list of changed squares and their new colors.\n    - When a snake dies, send a DeathNotification message to its client.\n    - When the game ends, send a WinnerAnnouncement message to all clients with the color of the last surviving snake.\n    - After the game ends, send a GameReset message to all clients.\n\n7.

Define the game state:\n    - A 100x100 grid to represent the game board.\n    - A list of snakes, each represented by a list of squares and a color.\n    - A list of squares that have changed since the last step.\n\n3. Define the WebSocket server:\n    - The server listens on localhost:8090.\n    - When a client connects, assign them a color and add a snake to the game state.\n    - When a client disconnects, remove their snake from the game state.\n\n4. Define the game loop:\n    - The loop runs at a rate of 15 steps per second.\n    - Each step, calculate the movement of each snake based on the last KeyEvent received from its client.\n    - If a snake moves into a wall or another snake, remove it from the game state and send a DeathNotification to its client.\n    - If a snake moves into a free square, add the square to the snake and to the list of changed squares.\n    - If only one snake remains, send a WinnerAnnouncement to all clients and reset the game state.\n\n5. Define the message handling:\n    - When a GameUpdate message is received, update the list of changed squares and their colors in the game state.\n    - When a KeyEvent message is received, update the direction of the corresponding snake.\n    - When a DeathNotification message is received, remove the corresponding snake from the game state.\n    - When a WinnerAnnouncement message is received, reset the game state.\n    - When a GameReset message is received, reset the game state.\n\n6. Define the message sending:\n    - At each step, send a GameUpdate message to all clients with the list of changed squares and their new colors.\n    - When a snake dies, send a DeathNotification message to its client.\n    - When the game ends, send a WinnerAnnouncement message to all clients with the color of the last surviving snake.\n    - After the game ends, send a GameReset message to all clients.\n\n7.
