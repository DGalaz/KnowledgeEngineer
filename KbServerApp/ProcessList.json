Setup the server:\n- Import necessary libraries: aiohttp for HTTP server, asyncio for asynchronous I/O, and websockets for WebSocket communication.\n- Define the game constants and initial game status as global variables.\n- Start an HTTP server that serves the file SnakeClient.html to clients.\n\n### 2. Handle client connections:\n- When a websocket connection is established, wait for a \"Joining\" message from the client. The \"Joining\" message should contain the client's username.\n- If the list of free snake characters is empty, close the websocket connection. Otherwise, assign a character to the client, update the game status to include the new client, and perform the \"Reset_A_Client\" operation.\n\n### 3. Handle client disconnections:\n- When a websocket disconnects, return the client's character to the list of free snake characters, erase the client's snake from the game board, and remove the client from the game status.\n\n### 4. Implement game logic:\n- Implement the \"Tick\" logic, which is executed five times per second. This logic moves each snake according to its direction, checks for collisions with the board edges or other snakes, updates scores, and handles food consumption.\n- Implement the \"Snake_Dies\" logic, which is triggered when a snake collides with the board edge or another snake. This logic sends a \"SnakeDied\" message to the client, erases the snake from the board, and performs the \"Reset_A_Client\" operation.\n- Implement the \"Reset_A_Client\" logic, which is used when a client joins the game or when a snake dies. This logic generates a new snake for the client at a random position, draws it on the game board, and resets the client's score and direction to zero and \"Stop\", respectively.\n\n### 5. Send game updates:\n- After each \"Tick\", send the updated game status to all connected clients. The game status should include the game board, the list of foods, and the list of clients with their scores and directions.\n\n## Client Side (SnakeClient.html)\n\n### 1. Setup the client:\n- Create the HTML structure for the game board and client list. The game board should be a 2D array of characters, and the client list should be a status bar at the bottom of the window.\n- Style the game board and client list using CSS. The game board should have a frame, and both the game board and client list should be resizable.\n- Connect to the server via websocket using JavaScript.\n\n### 2. Handle user input:\n- Prompt the user for a username and send a \"Joining\" message to the server. The \"Joining\" message should contain the username.\n- Detect arrow key presses and send \"DirectionChange\" messages to the server. The \"DirectionChange\" message should contain the new direction (\"Up\", \"Down\", \"Left\", or \"Right\").\n\n### 3. Handle server messages:\n- When a \"SnakeDied\" message is received, show a pop-up dialog to inform the user that their snake has died.\n- When a \"GameStatus\" message is received, update the game board and client list with the new information.\n\n### 4. Resize the game board:\n- Implement a function to resize the game board and its characters when the window size changes. This function should ensure that the game board always fits within the window and that the characters are always visible.\n```",
