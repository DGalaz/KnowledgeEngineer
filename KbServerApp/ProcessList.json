It initializes the game state and starts the server.\n\n2. **Client Handler Module**\n    - This module handles all client-related tasks. It assigns a color to each client that joins the game and sends the game state to each client.\n\n3. **Game Logic Module**\n    - This module calculates the movement of each snake, determines what snakes, if any, die, and what squares need color changes. It also updates the game state based on the change events to the arrow keys received from each client.\n\n4. **Countdown Module**\n    - This module initiates a 30-second countdown to the start of the game when the first client joins after the end of a game.\n\n5. **Winner Determination Module**\n    - This module determines the winner of the game and sends a \"Winner\" message to each client stating the color of the last surviving snake.\n\n6. **Communication Module**\n    - This module handles all the communication with the clients. It sends and receives messages using the specified protocol.\n\nThe structure of the server should be modular to allow for easy maintenance and updates. Each module should be responsible for a specific aspect of the game, and they should communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces."
