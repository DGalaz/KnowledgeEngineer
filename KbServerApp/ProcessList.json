Import necessary libraries:\n    - asyncio for asynchronous I/O, networking, and concurrency.\n    - websockets for WebSocket protocol handling.\n    - json for JSON serialization and deserialization.\n\n2. Define the SnakeServer class:\n    - Initialize the class with the following attributes:\n        - A list of clients.\n        - A dictionary to store the game state.\n        - A dictionary to store the arrow key states of each client.\n        - A dictionary to store the colors assigned to each client.\n        - A variable to store the game start countdown.\n        - A variable to store the current game state.\n\n3. Define the following methods in the SnakeServer class:\n    - `register_client`: Add a new client to the list of clients and assign a color to it.\n    - `unregister_client`: Remove a client from the list of clients.\n    - `update_arrow_key_state`: Update the arrow key state of a client.\n    - `calculate_game_state`: Calculate the game state 15 times per second. This includes the movement of each snake, determining if any snakes die, and determining what squares need color changes.\n    - `send_game_state`: Send the game state to each client.\n    - `announce_death`: Announce to a client if it has died.\n    - `announce_winner`: Announce the color of the last surviving snake at the end of the game.\n    - `manage_game_state_transition`: Manage the game start countdown and the transition between game states.\n\n4. Define the `start_server` function:\n    - Initialize a new instance of the SnakeServer class.\n    - Start the WebSocket server and register the necessary event handlers.\n\n5. In the `main` function:\n    - Call the `start_server` function.\n    - Start the asyncio event loop.\n\n6. If the script is run directly (not imported as a module), call the `main` function.",

It assigns a color to each client that joins the game and sends the game state to each client.\n\n3. **Game Logic Module**\n    - This module calculates the movement of each snake, determines what snakes, if any, die, and what squares need color changes. It also updates the game state based on the change events to the arrow keys received from each client.\n\n4. **Countdown Module**\n    - This module initiates a 30-second countdown to the start of the game when the first client joins after the end of a game.\n\n5. **Winner Determination Module**\n    - This module determines the winner of the game and sends a \"Winner\" message to each client stating the color of the last surviving snake.\n\n6. **Communication Module**\n    - This module handles all the communication with the clients. It sends and receives messages using the specified protocol.\n\nThe structure of the server should be modular to allow for easy maintenance and updates. Each module should be responsible for a specific aspect of the game, and they should communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces."
